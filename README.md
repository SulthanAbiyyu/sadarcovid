## About Project

This is a learning project showcase that i have been working for. It's quiet simple and ugly (duh), but I'm pretty happy with the result. I'm using ReactJS and [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/) API for fetching the data. I learn a lot about useState, useEffect, and data manipulation especially on application/json. For styling I use bootstrap 5 CDN, I don't really care about the styling at the moment.

   git clone https://github.com/SulthanAbiyyu/sadarcovid.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
